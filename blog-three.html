	<h3>What is Web Frameworks</h3>
	<p>By Abner Olivarez</p>

	<p>A <strong>Web Framework (WF)</strong> or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. 
	<br><br>For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites
	</p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>
		As the design of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> was not inherently dynamic, early hypertext consisted of hand-coded HTML text files that were published on web servers. Any modifications to published pages needed to be performed by the pages' author. In 1993, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard was introduced for interfacing external applications with web servers, to provide a dynamic web page that reflected user inputs.

		<br><br>Original implementations of the CGI interface typically had adverse effects on the server load however, because each request started a separate process.More recent implementations utilize persistent processes amongst other techniques to reduce the footprint in the server's resources and offer a general performance boost.

		<br><br>In 1995, fully integrated server/language development environments first emerged and new web-specific languages were introduced, such as <b>ColdFusion, PHP, and Active Server Pages</b>.

		<br><br>Although the vast majority of languages for creating dynamic web pages have libraries to help with common tasks, web applications often require specific libraries for particular tasks, such as creating HTML (for example, Jakarta Faces).

		<br><br>In the late 1990s, mature, "full stack" frameworks began to appear, that often gathered multiple libraries useful for web development into a single cohesive software stack for web developers to use.

	<h3>Types of Framework ArchitectureA</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Model–view–controller (MVC)</li>
		<li>Push-based vs. pull-based</li>
		<li>Three-tier organization</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Framework applications</h3>
	<p>Frameworks are built to support the construction of internet applications based on a single programming language, ranging in focus from general purpose tools such as Zend Framework and Ruby on Rails, which augment the capabilities of a specific language, to native-language programmable packages built around a specific user application, such as content management systems (CMS), some mobile development tools and some portal tools.
	</p>

	<h3>General-purpose website frameworks</h3>
	<p>
		Web frameworks must function according to the architectural rules of browsers and protocols such as HTTP, which is stateless. Webpages are served up by a server and can then be modified by the browser using JavaScript. Either approach has its advantages and disadvantages.

		<br><br>Server-side page changes typically require that the page be refreshed, but allow any language to be used and more computing power to be utilized. Client-side changes allow the page to be updated in small chunks which feels like a desktop application, but are limited to JavaScript and run in the user's browser, which may have limited computing power. Some mix of the two is typically used.[16] Applications which make heavy use of JavaScript and only refresh parts of the page, are called single-page applications and typically make use of a client-side JavaScript web framework to organize the code.

	<h3>Server Side</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Apache Wicket</li>
		<li>ASP.NET Core</li>
		<li>CakePHP</li>
		<li>Catalyst</li>
		<li>CodeIgniter</li>
		<li>CppCMS</li>
		<li>Django</li>
		<li>Express.js</li>
		<li>Flask</li>
		<li>Grails</li>
		<li>Jam.py</li>
		<li>Laravel</li>
		<li>Mojolicious</li>
		<li>Pop PHP Framework</li>
		<li>Phoenix</li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
		<li>Sails.js</li>
		<li>Symfony</li>
		<li>Spring MVC</li>
		<li>Yii</li>
		<li>Zend Framwork</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Client Side</h3>
	<p>Examples Include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Backbone.js</li>
		<li>AngularJS</li>
		<li>Angular</li>
		<li>Ember.js</li>
		<li>ReactJS</li>
		<li>jQuery< UI</li>
		<li>Svelte</li>
		<li>Vue.js</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p>
		Frameworks typically set the control flow of a program and allow the user of the framework to "hook into" that flow by exposing various events.This "inversion of control" design pattern is considered to be a defining principle of a framework, and benefits the code by enforcing a common flow for a team which everyone can customize in similar ways. For example, some popular "microframeworks" such as Ruby's Sinatra (which inspired Express.js) allow for "middleware" hooks prior to and after HTTP requests. These middleware functions can be anything, and allow the user to define logging, authentication and session management, and redirecting.
